Spring Cloud Contract moves TDD to the level of software architecture. It lets you perform consumer-driven and producer-driven contract testing.

NOTE: `5.0.0` release breaking changes: in keeping with the changes throughout the entire Spring Portfolio, support for `javax.inject` has been removed - `@Autowired` has to be used for the injection of the auto-configured Spring Cloud Contract components.
